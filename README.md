# Wholesale Customer Segmentation

Unsupervised Learning project using K-Means clustering to segment wholesale customers based on their annual spending on product categories.

## 📊 Overview

This project applies clustering algorithms on the [Wholesale Customers Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The aim is to identify customer segments that can help in marketing strategies and decision-making.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Apply K-Means Clustering on multivariate customer data.
- Visualize clusters and evaluate grouping effectiveness.
- Preprocess and scale features for better clustering accuracy.
- Interpret clusters using domain knowledge.

## 🧠 Methods Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Elbow Method for Optimal K
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- Cluster Visualization (2D)

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI ML Repository  
- **Attributes**: Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, Delicassen  
- **Customers**: 440  

## 📈 Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Visualizations

- Elbow Curve
- PCA-reduced cluster plots
- Spending distribution by cluster

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook: `Unsupervised_Learning_(K_Means_clustering)_solved.ipynb`
3. Run all cells step-by-step.
